  <!-- The goal of Common.targets is to insert a project in the poset of ProjectReferences. For example,
  a target that builds a nuget package needs to wait for the projects which build the binaries to complete. 
  To do that the target can add a PackageReference to those targts. It's not that simple however because some
  project types cannot be referenced by other project types (e.g. an iOS project cannot reference an Android project).
  Common.targets is constructed so it can reference any project and hence can wait for iOS, Android, Windows, etc.
  projects to complete before executing its build task.
  
  Most project files import a project specific targets when in turn imports Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets. For
  example, a C# project will import Microsoft.CSharp.targets which then imports Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets.
  Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets has the logic which ensures packageReference projects are built before
  the project while Microsoft.CSharp.targets prevents some types of project from being referenced. Common.targets,
  by referencing Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets directly, bypasses these checks and so can reference anything.
